#Salary Schedules

The City of Santa Monica publishes [employee salary schedules] (http://www.smgov.net/Departments/HR/Employees/Employees.aspx) in PDF format each fiscal year.

The aim of this project is to convert human-friendly PDF into machine-friendly JSON. 

This project uses the GPL Nuget package [iTextSharp] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/) to read data as text from PDF documents.
