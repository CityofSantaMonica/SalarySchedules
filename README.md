#Salary Schedules

The City of Santa Monica publishes [employee salary schedules] (http://www.smgov.net/Departments/HR/Employees/Employees.aspx) in PDF format each fiscal year.

The aim of this project is to convert human-friendly PDF into machine-friendly JSON. 

This project uses the [AGPL] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html) Nuget package [iTextSharp] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/) to read data as text from PDF documents.

Explore the data on the [gh-pages site](http://thekaveman.github.io/SalarySchedules/) (and take a look the code on the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/thekaveman/SalarySchedules/tree/gh-pages)).
